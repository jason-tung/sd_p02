## Testlet

### Abstract:
Teslet is a Quizlet inspired project which revolves around duplicating Quizletâ€™s core functionality: logging in, creating, saving, and viewing sets. Team azrael will try to also implement various ways to expedite the process of set creation and reviewing sets, most notably autofill definitions and enabled pronunciation on terms/definitions. Using javascript, we will try to update a container in while reviewing sets to imitate flipping an index card.

### How To Procure Your Own API Keys:
Our project utilizes various APIs, so the user needs a json file with the API keys formatted as such (the skeleton is provided under `/keys/<api_name>):

```
FILE: MSAzureTTS API
CONTENTS:xxxxxxxxxx
```
This will be elaborated upon in the instructions. Just fetch your API keys for now.


All of the APIs we used are hyperlinked in the table below with a brief description. The hyperlinks should be sufficient to get the user started on procuring API keys. Please note that not all of the apis need keys.

[calendar index](https://www.calendarindex.com/)  | Gives dates of holidays and observances
[sunrise-sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) | Provides time for sunrise, high noon, and sunset
[darksky](https://darksky.net/dev) | To get the past, current, and future weather at a location
[ipapi](https://ipapi.co/)  | To get the information about location based on ip address
[horoscope-api](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Horoscope-API) | To get the daily, weekly, monthly horoscope
